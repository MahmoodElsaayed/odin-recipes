            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Chicken shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish consisting of marinated and grilled or roasted chicken that is thinly sliced. It is typically served in a warm pita bread or wrapped in a flatbread, accompanied by various toppings such as tahini sauce, pickles, tomatoes, and onions. The chicken is often seasoned with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, garlic, and lemon juice, resulting in a flavorful and tender meat dish.
