            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Beef ramen is a savory and comforting Japanese noodle soup dish. It features a flavorful broth made from simmering beef bones, vegetables, and spices for an extended period. The broth is then combined with cooked ramen noodles and topped with tender slices of beef, along with various garnishes like green onions, seaweed, boiled eggs, and bamboo shoots. The result is a hearty and satisfying meal with rich umami flavors
